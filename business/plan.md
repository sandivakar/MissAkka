### 1. Market Analysis

#### 1.1 Industry Overview
The ethical fashion and artisanal product markets are rapidly growing as consumers increasingly value fair trade and sustainability. MISS AKKA capitalizes on these trends by offering both clothing and global craftsmanship, catering to customers who seek self-expression and ethical choices.

#### 1.2 Target Market
- *Demographics:* Women aged 18-50, with a focus on inclusivity and offering XL and XXL sizes. We will also focus on children's clothing for girls aged 4-8.
- *Psychographics:* Environmentally conscious, spiritual, creative, values unique craftsmanship, and seeks a style that stands outside the mainstream.

#### 1.3 Market Trends
- Growing demand for sustainably and ethically produced clothing and products.
- Increasing interest in handmade and unique items that reflect craftsmanship and culture.
- Preference for fair trade products, especially among younger consumers who prioritize authenticity and ethics.
- Limited availability of bohemian, rebellious style for children (especially girls aged 4-8) and for fuller European body sizes, presenting a market opportunity.

#### 1.4 Competitor Analysis
- *Direct Competitors:* Local and online sustainable bohemian brands and sellers of artisanal products. Limited competition in the children's clothing segment.

#### 2.1 Products
- Dresses, tops, skirts, and accessories in bohemian, rebellious styles made from sustainable materials.
- Handcrafted products from artisans worldwide, including jewelry, bags, and home decor items, discovered during travels.
