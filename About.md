# About Us

## Introduction
Welcome to **MISS AKKA**, a brand rooted in individuality, strength, and a passion for self-expression. Our unique, self-designed clothing invites you to celebrate your own journey with pride.

## My Journey
I’m Kelly, the founder of MISS AKKA. My journey began in 2018 with a seven-month backpacking adventure across Southeast Asia. When I returned home in 2019, I felt restless and unfulfilled, with a constant desire for more. I became addicted to traveling, planning one trip after another, and spent the following years exploring as much as I could. Then, in 2024, I traveled to Sri Lanka, where the idea of MISS AKKA was born. It was there that I finally found a deeper purpose, connecting my love for exploration with a vision for a brand that would inspire others.

## In Sri Lanka
On my journey through Sri Lanka, I met my “Mali,” which means “little brother.” His community welcomed me with open arms, calling me “Akka,” or “big sister.” This bond inspired me to start MISS AKKA, a brand dedicated to the spirit of family, support, and the belief in being true to oneself. This experience is at the heart of everything we create.

## What “Akka” Means
In the spirit of “Akka,” meaning “big sister,” we strive to offer support and strength to everyone who wears our clothing. MISS AKKA is more than a fashion label; it’s a reminder to embrace your own journey with confidence and pride.
